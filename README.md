This class project is written in Java and focuses on displaying objects and shapes in the JFrame container. Recursive fractals are used to display a "triangle carpet" made up of graphics objects that are modified as polygons. Each corner of the triangle has its own coordinate which is affected by the recursive statement as it is passed down. This project furthered my understanding of how integers and graphic objects react to recursive statements.
